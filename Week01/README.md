## Overview
Review content from HTML and CSS. Note, depending on how much the students remember, it may be worth spending more than one day on these concepts.

## Student introductions
Since this is the first week of the club, allow the students to introduce themselves. They can share their school and grade level, and something fun like their favorite movie or tv show or an interesting fact about themselves.

## Review Kahoot
A Kahoot to gauge what the students remember: https://play.kahoot.it/#/k/9da0c22b-48ae-479f-9c7f-c0bfd458a2b5

This quiz covers HTML and CSS concepts.

## Follow-Along Activity
Follow-along coding to help refresh the students' memory, or re-teach them. There is a `FollowAlong.html` file and a `FollowAlongComplete.html` file. Start from the FollowAlong file, and build up to the FollowAlongComplete file. Be sure to explain the thought process behind every change. Ask the students for suggestions about what to type. Throughout the exercise, ask questions about the code that already exists.

Note that the follow-along activity can be quick in the interest of giving the students time to work on the individual activity.

### Instructions
- Add a paragraph about Hyland above the first paragraph
- Add in an address field
    - Add a div around the input
    - Add the input and label
    - Add the inputContainer class
    - Add an id to the input
    - Add a style for the id updating the width
- Give the "Finished" button a border using the "blackBorder" class
- Add the "blackBorder" class to the textarea
- Give the "Finished" button a box shadow when hovering over it using the "hoverShadow" class

## Individual Activity
Something for the students to work on by themselves. They will need to build out a basic HTML file from scratch, using the concepts reviewed in the Follow-Along. The webpage will be them introducing themselves to the rest of the class, and each student can present what they come up with briefly.

## Challenge
If the students complete the Individual activity with time to spare, they can attempt the challenge.
