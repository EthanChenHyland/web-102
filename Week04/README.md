## Overview
This lesson introduces ways to make JavaScript more usable. These concepts will be used throughout the remainder of the course. This lesson covers:
- Separate JavaScript Files
- Buttons

## Warm Up
Prompt the students with the following, and allow them to ponder it briefly:
- How many different buttons might you find on a website?
- Based on how we currently make our webpages, do you foresee any problems as our websites become more complex?

Discussion will take place during the lecture. The purpose of this will be to help the students understand __why__ it is important to split up code into multiple files.

## Lecture
The lecture introduces the following concepts:
- External JS Files
- Buttons

## Follow-Along Activity
Create a Darth Vader soundboard: [SoundboardFollowAlongInstructions.md](SoundboardFollowAlongInstructions.md)

## Review Activity
For this activity, the students will be split up into 3 teams (2 teams of 5, 1 team of 4). Each team will be given a whiteboard to fill out their answers.

The instructors will pull up the [Review](./Review.pptx) powerpoint to display the review questions to the students (Note: the answers are displayed on the slides following the questions). The students will have time to fill out an answer. After a certain amount of time, the instructors will count down and ask each of the teams to hold up their answers. Each team will get a point for every answer they get correctly. If anyone is talking outside of the time they have to discuss an answer, that team will be deducted a point.

- Add more tricky questions to the review

If there is a tie at the end of the round, the tie-breaker question will be used.

The team with the highest amount of points gets candy at the end.

## Individual Activity
The students will update the Darth Vader soundboard by following the instructions in [SoundboardIndividualInstructions.md](SoundboardIndividualInstructions.md).

## Challenge
There are additional challenges contained in [Challenges.md](Challenges.md)
