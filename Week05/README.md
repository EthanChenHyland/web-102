Introduce booleans and conditional statements. Explain that the computer understands these statements in the same way humans understand English (or any other language). There is a PowerPoint which includes a mini-quiz covering these topics.

## Be the Computer
For this activity, each student will pretend they are a computer reading instructions through code. They will have to act out the actions described in pseudo-JavaScript programs. It may be helpful to invite one student to demonstrate for the examples.
